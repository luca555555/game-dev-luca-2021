<p>Stone/metals AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Gold, steel, granit

X = couldn't find anything / super inconsistent info

I've gotten to disposal and I'm now starting to feel like I may have misunderstood the criteria slightly but I'm too lazy to restart :/

General information | steel
1.link
important engineering and construction material | cars, appliances, ships | 3,500 different grades of steel with many different physical, chemical, and environmental properties.
2.link
It's generally lighter and stronger than something like wood making it easier simpler and cheaper to work with 
3.link
Corrosion and it isn't fireproof 

General information | gold
1.link
47% investments 38% jewelry 8% in electronics 
2.link
It offers some protection from market inflation/volatility || looks nice || superior electric conductivity
3.
All i could find is a bunch of stuff about how its riskier to buy than like a stock or something

General information | granit
1.link
Walkways, countertops, floors, mostly outdoor decoration though 
2.link
It doesn't weather fast, eco friendly, it still looks nice after being lived with for a while
3. link. 
Expensive, might need more cabinet support, needs to get a sealing thingy every year 















Extraction | steel
1.link
Steel is made from iron by removing impurities and adding substances such as manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, and vanadium
2.
No its ore in the ground we can't get it back
3.link
Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining. Some underground mines do exist, but, wherever possible, surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.
4.link
AUSTRALIA
Brazil
China
5. link 
The global iron and steel industry accounts for approximately 5% of total global CO2 emissions. On average, 1.9 tonnes of CO2 are emitted for every tonne of steel produced. 
6.link 
94,400 Btu per ton.
7.link
The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.
8.link, link
mine exploration, construction, operation, and maintenance may result in land-use change, and may have associated negative impacts on environments, including deforestation, erosion, contamination and alteration of soil profiles, contamination of local streams and wetlands, and an increase in noise level, dust and emissions
Different lung diseases including lung cancer are the major occupational diseases among the workers of iron ore dust










Extraction | gold
1.
You can make like radioactive gold from platinum or magnesium but actual gold is found in it pure form 
2.link. 
formed from geological processes that span millions of years so no
3.link
open-pit or underground mining gold is separated from the gold-bearing rock with chemical processes involving toxic substances
4.link
China
Australia
Russia
5.link. 
100 Mt CO2-e || 100 million metric tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent annually
6.A7
7.Link
Open-pit mining
Eliminates topsoil and causes soil erosion cause buried rocks to be exposed and emit harmful chemicals
Water and air pollution and species extinction
Also uses underground mining*
8.A7


Extraction | granit
1.
Just the granite itself
2.link 
Again millions of years to form so no
3.link
mountainous quarry
4.link
Spain
China
Italy 
5.
Can't find a number but it does produce them 
6.
7.link 
Air pollution ;-;
8.






Manufacturing | steel
1.link, link, link
the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route.
Blast furnace > the iron ore is smelted to remove impurities > add carbon 
Electric arc furnace > 
1. The furnace is charged with the material
2. The roof is lowered and closed
3. Electrodes are lowered onto the material to form the arc between the material and the electrodes
4. Arc is struck at a lower voltage which is thereafter increased to speed up the melting process. The arc heats the material to a molten state
5. While melting takes place the refining process starts with the oxidising of certain elements
2.link
China
India
Japan 
3.link
Constant noise can lead to hearing loss, daily use of power tools and heavy machinery can lead to nerve damage, and working with dangerous chemicals 
4.link 
many toxic gasses (e.g. carbon monoxide/CO, carbon dioxide/CO₂) as well as explosive gasses (e.g. methane/CH₄) are released during steel production 
5.link. 
1.85 tonnes CO2 per tonne of steel produced
6.link
Steel requires about 20 gigajoules of energy per ton produced mostly from burning coal 
7.link
Uses a lot of coke witch emits air pollution witch is highly toxic and can cause cancer 
Cokeing waist  water also is super toxic
8.x



Manufacturing | gold
1.link 
miller process
-melt it down with an induction furnace 
-blow chlorine gas acros it causing impurities to rise to the top
-skin off impurities to make 99.95% pure gold

Wohlwill process
-I understand none of this one but the link is there 
2.link 
China
Australia
Russia
3.
Chlorine gas
4.x
5.x
6.x
7.x

Manufacturing | granite
1.link
Cut & polish
2.x
3.
None that I can find 
4.link
High risk of developing silicosis from being exposed to silica dust  
5.
No number
6.link
Most of the bad stuff comes from the extraction process cutting/polishing can take a lot of electricity and water but its comparable to gathering wood 
7.6A
8.6A



Distribution | steel
1.
distributed
2.link. 
Barge, rail, truck they all use gas uwu
3.link 
Apparently there are a lot of physical places that sell steel but its also available online
4.
I think steel is sold at a discounted cost 
5.x

Distribution | gold
1.x
2.
So you can kind of just transport this however you want car plane the mail obv gas is a thing  but how much depends on the chosen method 
3.link 
It seems to be mostly a thing you buy online unless you want gold jewelry then yeah you have a lot of options
4.
Well gold is used mainly as investment the whole point of it is to be sold at its true price imo
5.x

Distribution | granite
1.

2.
Same thing boat, truck
3.link 
It's mostly in stores
4.
I think granite is sold around its true price maybe slightly over valued because its produced on mass
5.x





Consumption | steel
1.link
Steel usually last for quite a long time if properly maintained example steel building will last around 50 years before you will even start to experience problems
2.x
3.
I could find nothing major
4.
Nothing I could find past what was already mentioned
5.
Steel is usually used for a lot of different things when its used for something like a car or a ship it can be resold to really as many other people as needed its also not super difficult to repair 
6.x

Consumption | gold
(Since investment and jewelry are things that don't really get discarded i'll focus on electronics)
1.link. 
the average consumer buy a new phone about every 2 - 3 years
2.link
Phones and technologie in general are fairly egregious with using planned obsolescence in various ways like slowing down software 
3.
Nothing provable i could find
4.x
5.
It can be used by more than one person although its not ideal repairs can be done but depending on how bad the damage is not usually worth it
6.x

Consumption | granite 
1.link
Around 30 years
2.x
3.link
Some stuff about potential high levels of radon in some countertops 
4.x


5.
In theory i guess you could rip up garden stones countertop etc and make something else out of em but there is no repairing granite 
6.x


Disposal | steel
1.link
Steel is one of the metals you can bring into a local scrap yard or something and get paid for dropping it off
2.link
yup steel is bought as scrap to be reused
3.x
4.x
5.x
6.
7.link
It can erode back into iron oxide and rust


Disposal | Gold
1.
Is recycled uwu
2.link 
Basically the exact same way its made in the first place
3.x
4.
The same amount of toxins as making gold
5.
Again same thinggg
6.x
7.link
No it kinda just stays as gold







Disposal | granite
1.
Mostly garbage but can be recycled cant find how though
